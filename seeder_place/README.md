# Find PLACE motifs in Seeder results
The seeder_place.py file will take a file with Seeder results that looks like this:
    10009 CGTGGC 3.62843e-03
    10015 CCGACC 7.29131e-03
    10033 AGGCGG 1.25627e-04
    10033 TATATA 2.51254e-04

and will create an HTML page with links to PLACE for motifs that were found there.
